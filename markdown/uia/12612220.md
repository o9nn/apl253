# 12612220 - Ground-level visibility

## Template

A primary function of frameworks is to provide a link between a bounded space and the external environment, especially the immediate context in which it is grounded.

## Physical

One of the window's most important functions is to give contact with the outdoors. Low sills provide the most meaningful links because they offer a view of the ground under the window. They should not be too low or the window feels unsafe. Higher sills are desirable on higher floors.
