# 12612250 - Thickened boundary interfaces

## Template

Boundaries may be given special significance and functionality by making them thick enough to establish a significant zone of their own rather than being merely a thin divider between domains.

## Physical

Window and door frames, being thick enough that they are places in themselves - places where you can sit, lean, and feel the transition between inside and outside.

## Social

Boundary roles or positions that have their own identity and function, not just dividing two groups but serving as a meaningful space of their own.

## Conceptual

Transition concepts or bridging ideas that are substantial enough to be areas of study in themselves, not just thin dividers between fields.

## Psychic

Threshold states of awareness that are rich and meaningful in themselves, not just quick transitions between mental states.
