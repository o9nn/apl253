# 12612270 - Inter-level integrity

## Template

The integrity of a framework depends on that of the connections between its elements. These are most critical at transitions in orientation, and especially at those where inter- level elements connect with those of a higher level. It is at these positions that some form of reinforcement is required.

## Physical

The strength of a structural framework depends on the strength of its connections. These connections are most critical of all at corners, especially at the corners where the columns meet the beams. Such connections may either be seen as a source of rigidity, which can be strengthened by triangulation using a brace, or as a source of continuity, which helps the forces to flow easily in the process of transferring loads by changing the direction of the force, as in the use of a capital.
