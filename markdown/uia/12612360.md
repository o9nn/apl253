# 12612360 - Displaceable frameworks

## Template

Frameworks which can be completely set aside to permit direct interaction with the external world are preferable to fixed or partially movable frameworks.

## Physical

Windows which open wide permit personal contact with the outside environment. They are a place to linger, through which to talk to others outside. Modern buildings tend to be constructed with fixed or partially opening windows which inhibit this degree of contact.
