# 12612180 - Distortion resistant boundaries

## Template

Boundaries enclosing spaces may contribute to the overall structural integrity of the framework by the manner in which they act to resist its distortion. Such fully integrated boundaries should be contrasted with those which enclose and define spaces but do not contribute to the overall structural integrity.

## Physical

In organic construction, walls, acting as structural membranes, take their share of loads. They work continuously with the structure on all four of their sides; and act to resist shear and bending, and take loads in compression. Such walls are built as a membrane which connects the columns and door frames and window frames and is, at least in part, continuous with them.
