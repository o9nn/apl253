# 12612260 - Inter-level zone

## Template

Isolated inter-level connections in a framework may have useful additional, non-structural functions, but only if they are formed so as to establish a significant zone of influence around them.

## Physical

Free-standing columns play a role in shaping human space. Each marks a point. Two or more define an enclosure. A column thus creates a space for human activity if it permits places to be established around it where people can sit and lean comfortably. A thin column, only fulfilling its structural requirements, does not engender a comfortable environment.
