# 12612400 - Tolerance at level interfaces

## Template

Provision of suitably scaled intermediate positions permits a realistic degree of tolerance at interfaces between frameworks of different levels. Such tolerance is necessary if there is to be freedom in any design and implementation process.

## Physical

A free and natural building cannot be conceived without the possibility of using trim to cover minor variations and mistakes during the construction process. In modern system building the necessary tolerances are reduced by eliminating any possibility of freedom in the building plan. Trim serves the vital additional function of ensuring adequate perceptual continuity between the fine structure of natural materials and the dimensions of the smallest constructional elements. Without such continuity the building is experienced as alienating.

## Social

In the natural development of an organization allowances must be made for minor inconsistencies in the working relationships between its constituent groups, especially those at different hierarchical levels. Such inconsistencies can only be avoided by detailed pre-planning intolerant of any spontaneously instituted variations during the organization's development. The manner in which such inconsistencies are integrated into the life of the organization may well contribute to its qualifications as a human organization rather than as an inhuman one.

## Conceptual

In the natural development of a conceptual framework, allowance must be made for minor inconsistencies in the relationships between its constituent modules, especially those at different levels of abstraction. Such inconsistencies can only be avoided by absolute adherence to an all-embracing framework intolerant of any variations which may emerge as desirable during its implementation. The manner in which such inconsistencies are integrated into the conceptual framework may well contribute to its qualifications as realistic rather than as unrealistic.

## Psychic

In the natural development of a mode of awareness allowance must be made for minor inconsistencies in the relationships between its various aspects, especially those at different levels. Such inconsistencies can only be avoided by adherence to a single overriding intention intolerant of any variation which may emerge as desirable in practice. The manner in which such inconsistencies are integrated into the mode of awareness may well contribute to its acceptance as acceptable rather than as unacceptable.
