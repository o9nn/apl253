# 12612060 - Efficient enclosure of spaces with minimal structural distinctions

## Template

The most efficient way of distributing distinctions throughout a framework so as to enclose space, providing appropriate structural integrity with the minimum number of elements, is to conceive of the framework as made from one continuous body of mutually constrained elements.

## Physical

The most efficient way of distributing materials throughout a building, so as to enclose space, strongly and well, with the least amount of expensive, non-depletable material, is to conceive of the building as made from one continuous body of compressive material. In its geometry, conceive it as a three-dimensional system of individually vaulted spaces, most of them roughly rectangular; with thin load-bearing walls, each stiffened by columns at intervals along its length, thickened where walls meet walls, vaults, or openings. tj M b Efficient enclosure of spaces with minimal structural distinctions
