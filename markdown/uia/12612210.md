# 12612210 - Aperture compatibility

## Template

A rigid plan combined with a formal aesthetic results in apertures neither of the appropriate sizes nor compatibly located. Decision on size and placement should be finally determined only when the basic framework has been constructed.

## Physical

Finding the right position for a window or a door is a subtle matter. Minor changes in size or placement make an immense difference. Rather than using standard sizes and pre-planned positions, exact positions and sizes should be determined on site once the framework has been built.
