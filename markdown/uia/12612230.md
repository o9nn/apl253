# 12612230 - Zones of intermediate insight

## Template

Well-defined apertures into a bounded space result in strong contrasts in illumination to which it is difficult to adjust. Intermediate levels of contrast are required.

## Physical

Windows with a sharp edge where the frame meets the wall create harsh, blinding glare, and make the rooms they serve uncomfortable. By making the frame a deep, splayed edge, angled to the plane of the window, a gentle gradient of daylight gives a smooth transition between the light of the window and of the dark inner wall.
