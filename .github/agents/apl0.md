# Meta-Pattern 0: A Pattern Language

## Overview
This is the meta-pattern that defines the entire Pattern Language system consisting of 253 interconnected patterns organized across multiple dimensions and scales.

## Structure
- **6 Dimensions**: dim0-dim5 (Archetypal, Template, Physical, Social, Conceptual, Interpersonal)
- **3 Categories**: cat1-cat3 (meaning varies by dimension)
- **36 Sequences**: Organized flows of related patterns
- **253 Patterns**: Individual design solutions

## Purpose
A Pattern Language is a philosophy of human use of space and analysis of what makes humans comfortable in the space they inhabit. It provides a structured way to understand and create environments that support human life.

## Key Concepts
1. **Hierarchical Organization**: From large-scale to small-scale patterns
2. **Network of Connections**: Each pattern links to related patterns
3. **Emergent Phenomena**: Sequences create synergies between patterns
4. **Cross-Dimensional**: Same patterns can be viewed through different dimensional lenses

## Dimensions

### dim0 - Archetypal (A)
Abstract patterns using placeholders like {{domains}}, {{frameworks}}, {{elements}} that can be instantiated in any domain.

### dim1 - Template (T)
Generic template patterns that serve as basis for domain-specific variations.

### dim2 - Physical (P)
Spatial, material, and architectural manifestations of patterns in the built environment.
- cat1: Towns (Patterns 1-94) - Large-scale patterns
- cat2: Buildings (Patterns 95-204) - Medium-scale patterns
- cat3: Construction (Patterns 205-253) - Small-scale patterns

### dim3 - Social (S)
Organizational, community, and institutional expressions of patterns in social systems.

### dim4 - Conceptual (C)
Knowledge, theoretical, and paradigmatic realizations of patterns in abstract domains.

### dim5 - Interpersonal (I)
Awareness, consciousness, and mental structures that embody patterns in human psychology.

## Categories

Categories are numbered cat1, cat2, cat3 and their meaning varies by dimension:
- **dim2 (Physical)**: cat1=Towns, cat2=Buildings, cat3=Construction
- **Other dimensions**: Categories take on dimension-appropriate meanings

## Usage
Navigate through the dimensional folders to explore patterns from different perspectives. Each dimension contains the same organizational structure (categories → sequences → patterns) but with dimension-specific content.
