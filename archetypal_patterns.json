The plans should therefore be rather loose and fluid in order to accommodate those subtleties as the need for them emerges. The building should not be thought of as assembled from components but rather as being woven from a structure which starts out globally complete, but flimsy. It is gradually made stiffer, whilst still somewhat flimsy, until it is made completely stiff and strong in the final construction phase. Although the building goes from flimsy to strong, the actual materials added go from the strongest and stiffest to the less stiff, until finally fluid materials are added. In this way each new material is more adaptable, more flexible, more capable of coping with variations (and earlier mistakes) than the last.
