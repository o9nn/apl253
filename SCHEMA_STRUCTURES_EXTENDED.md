### Example: Pattern Sequence #1 across Domains

**Original**: "Regions instead of countries"

- **Cell**: "Cellular regions instead of uniform cytoplasm"
- **OS**: "Memory regions instead of flat address spaces"

- **GitHub**: "Organizations instead of individual repositories"
- **Azure**: "Tenants instead of single subscriptions"
- **Pattern Language**: "Pattern domains instead of isolated patterns"
- **Ontology**: "Semantic realms instead of flat vocabularies"

## Usage Instructions for Extended Domains

### How to Apply Domain-Specific Patterns

1. **Identify your domain context** from the 12 available interpretations
2. **Select the appropriate pattern language** using domain-specific terminology
3. **Follow the same hierarchical structure** (Large → Mid → Fine scale)
4. **Adapt generic relationships** to domain-appropriate connections
5. **Maintain pattern sequence logic** while using domain vocabulary

### Pattern Hierarchies (Evidence Levels) - Universal

- **Two asterisks (★★)**: True invariants across all domains - impossible to solve without this pattern
- **One asterisk (★)**: Progress made toward domain invariant - improvement possible
- **No asterisks**: Domain-specific solution provided but true invariant remains to be found

### Cross-Domain Pattern Translation

Each pattern can be systematically translated across domains using the transformation mappings:

```
Generic Concept → Domain-Specific Terms
domain → [network topology | cellular environment | system space | model space | enterprise | tenant | pattern language | ontological space | reflective space | hypergraph space | self-knowing realm | transformation space]
organization → [network architecture | organelle structure | system architecture | model structure | repositories | tenant architecture | pattern hierarchy | ontological structure | reflective structure | hypergraph structure | self-organizing structure | transformation architecture]
elements → [nodes/neurons | organelles/proteins | processes/threads | tokens/embeddings | commits/issues | resources/services | patterns/elements | concepts/entities | thoughts/reflections | vertices/hyperedges | self-aware agents | transformers/agents]
```

## Validation and Coherence

### Domain Consistency Checks

1. **Terminology Alignment**: Each domain uses consistent vocabulary throughout all patterns
2. **Hierarchical Coherence**: Large → Mid → Fine scale organization maintained
3. **Relationship Preservation**: Generic relationships properly translated to domain context
4. **Pattern Sequence Logic**: 36-sequence structure preserved with appropriate domain language
5. **Cross-Reference Integrity**: Pattern connections work within domain terminology

### Validation Criteria

✅ **Format Consistency**: All domains follow identical JSON schema structure  
✅ **Terminology Coherence**: Domain-specific terms align with established vocabularies  
✅ **Hierarchical Logic**: Three-tier organization preserved across all domains  
✅ **Sequence Integrity**: 36 pattern sequences maintained with domain adaptations  
✅ **Relationship Mapping**: Generic relationships appropriately translated  
✅ **Cross-Domain Compatibility**: Patterns can be translated between domains using mapping tables

This extended schema provides a comprehensive framework for applying Pattern Language principles across diverse domains while maintaining structural coherence and domain-appropriate terminology.
